# Jarrett's Personal Website 

Personal website to showcase my current & future projects with source codes for some.

# TECHNOLOGY USED

React Js is used for the frontend, while Node Js hosted with AWS Amplify is used for the backend. Bootstrap is used for the HTML & CSS designs.

# FEEDBACKS

I would love & appreciate any feedbacks or improvements that could be made to my website; be it the design or code based. Thank You!

Add 'Tech Stack' row to the 'Skills Learnt' row. Remove ul dots with tick signs.
