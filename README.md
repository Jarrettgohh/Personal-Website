# Jarrett's Personal Website 

Personal website to showcase my current & future projects with source codes for some.

# FEATURE IDEAS
- Add 'forums' at the bottom of each project pages; something for visitors to leave comments or discuss an issue.

# TO NOTE 
URL EXTENSION "/Personal-Website/" instead of "/Personal-Website" else image would not load.

# TECHNOLOGY USED

React Js is used for the frontend with Bootstrap being used for the HTML & CSS designs.

# FEEDBACKS

I would love & appreciate any feedbacks or improvements that could be made to my website; be it the design or code based. Thank You!


# CURRENT ISSUES

On click of "soure code" in the projects card, under "Programming Projects", the project page renders too. 
####
Expected behavior ==> Open github repo, but page remains.
