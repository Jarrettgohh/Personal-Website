          While working on a mobile app for my startup idea, I have realise the
          importance of AI/ML integration to improve the business prospect.
          Moreover, I am also really interested in this field, and am actively
          learning about the concepts of AI/ML to leverage the data I could
          potentially gather from the user base of my mobile app. I plan to use
          the data to build AI/ML models to improve my customer value capture
          and creation. From the various books I have read, I have learnt many
          concepts on this field, and how other companies leverages their data
          to improve their business as a whole.

          Through my exploration of AI/ML concepts in Tensorflow Keras, I have
          learnt of the multiple components that makes up the neural network
          such as loss function (binary cross-entropy, categorical
          cross-entropy), model layers (text vectorization, LSTM, 1D
          convolution, embedding) and activation function (rectified linear
          unit, sigmoid, softmax).

          I am also reading a book titled{" "}
          <strong>Competing in the age of AI</strong>, where I have learnt about
          the importance of AI/ML, software and algorithmns in startups,
          business or anywhere that data is involved. On top of that, I have
          learnt about the categories of AI, namely supervised learning,
          unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning.

          During my internship experience at A*STAR IME, I was fortunate enough
          to be able to work on computer automation projects to automate the
          process of data extraction and compilation. The goal of the project
          was to optimize and ease the process of data extraction/compilation,
          so as to reduce human error, and overall improve efficiency.

          Despite being a beginner in AI/ML or the whole concept of data
          science, I am willing to work hard to learn more about it, as I
          believe it is the future!
